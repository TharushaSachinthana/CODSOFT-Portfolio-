## How I Built This Portfolio

I built my portfolio using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. Here's a brief overview of the technologies and tools I used:

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS:** Applied styles to make the portfolio visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented dynamic features and interactions.
- **GitHub Pages:** Deployed and hosted the portfolio.

Feel free to explore the code in this repository to see how I structured the project and implemented different features.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
